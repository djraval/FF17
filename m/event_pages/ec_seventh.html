		<h2>Simulation Contest (MATLAB, Scilab, Quartus)</h2>
		<em></em>
		<p>Event based on debugging, coding and simulating using any simulator tool.<br>

Rounds Scheme:
<br><br>Round 1 (Elimination Round): Debugging 
<br>Each team is required to solve the errors in the given code and then explain the objective of the code.
<br><br>Round 2 (Final Round): Simulation 
<br>The teams have to design a program code and simulate it. The objective of the question program will be provided beforehand (one day before the round 2,after the declaration of the teams selected for the next round). If the program is perfectly simulated, modifications will be given.
</p>
		<p>1.	30 minutes will be allotted for debugging the code.
<br>2.	10 teams will be selected for the second round. 
<br>3.	30 minutes will be provided to perform the modifications in the program.
</p>
