		<h2>ChargeOn (Workshop)</h2>
		<em></em>
		<p>ChargeOn is the kick start workshop for 1st and 2nd year students who are interested in doing projects. The workshop will be conducted in 3 phases as described below:
<br>
Phase 1:
<br>•	Basic introduction about how to approach the project and how to plan timing for doing specific tasks involved within it as they would not have done work on real life projects until now.
<br>•	Brief description of all the components included in the project along with how to read important things from datasheet will be taught.
<br>•	Circuit diagram of the project will be explained thoroughly by senior student coordinators.
<br><br>Phase 2:
<br>•	Kit of all the components will be provided after which each team has to design power supply based on the circuit diagram explained in phase 1.
<br><br>Phase 3:
<br>•	Future guidance on what projects students can make during vacation period will be given based on arduino and micro-controllers depending upon their interests in the particular field.
