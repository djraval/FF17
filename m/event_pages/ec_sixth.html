		<h2>Resistance Rapture</h2>
		<em></em>
		<p>Event based on Basic Electrical & Electronics Engg.  And Electronics Principles
<br>
Rounds scheme:
<br><br>Round 1: This round consist of 3 task [Elimination Round]
<br>Task 1: 5 questions will be asked in succession and the participants have to answer  the question in ‘yes’ or ‘no’ quickly. The question will not be repeated second time.  
<br>Task 2: This task will include identification of symbols (logo). Cards with technical symbols will be given to the participants and they have to identify 3 cards within 30 seconds.
<br>Task 3: This task contains 10 multiple choice question on paper. Time limit is 15 minute.
<br>Time Duration: 2 hour 

<br><br>Round 2: This round consist of 3 task [for the qualified participants from the first round]
<br>Task 1: The participants will be given few values of resistances. They will be given some commonly used resistors which they have to identify using the color coding. Using these they have to design simple networks such that the equivalent resistance is equal to the given resistances values. Time limit is 15 minutes.
<br>Task 2: A network circuit diagram will be given to the participants and they have to solve the network diagram using series, parallel and star-delta method(The required equations will be provided). Time limit is 20 minutes.
<br>Task 3: Participants who have solved network circuit diagram correctly will be allowed to implement it on the bread board.
<br>Time Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes
