		<h2>Code Crunch</h2>
		<em>Talk is cheap, show me the code</em>
		<p>The main motive of a program is to satisfy the intentions of the user. If you think your code can satisfy our intentions, you have entered the right place. And as someone has said “Give someone a program, frustrate him for a day. Teach someone to program; frustrate him/her for lifetime”. If you have learnt to get frustrated for a lifetime, get frustrated for a day then.</p>
