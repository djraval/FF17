Cards with technical symbols will be given to the participants and they have to identify 3 cards within 30 seconds.\r\nTask 3: This task contains 10 multiple choice question on paper. Time limit is 15 minute.\r\nTime Duration: 2 hour \r\n\r\nRound 2: This round consist of 3 task [for the qualified participants from the first round]\r\nTask 1: The participants will be given few values of resistances. They will be given some commonly used resistors which they have to identify using the color coding. Using these they have to design simple networks such that the equivalent resistance is equal to the given resistances values. Time limit is 15 minutes.\r\nTask 2: A network circuit diagram will be given to the participants and they have to solve the network diagram using series, parallel and star-delta method(The required equations will be provided). Time limit is 20 minutes.\r\nTask 3: Participants who have solved network circuit diagram correctly will be allowed to implement it on the bread board.\r\nTime Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes\r\n",

Out of the teams who have registered, only 10 will be allowed to go for the next round. This round will be completed within 30 mins.\r\n\r\nRound 2: This round is divided into 2 parts. The first part is a technical quiz consisting of MCQ\u2019s and other short questions based on Boolean reduction, digital electronics and network analysis. After this the team will be provided with a comprehensive passage followed by 10 questions. The passage will consists of several encoded words and phrases that have to be deciphered by the participants with the help of the key provided. The result of this round will be used to shortlist 5 teams for the final round. Time limit for this round will be 1 hour.\r\n\r\nRound 3: The teams which reach this round will get the opportunity to take part in an auction to buy various virtual electronic goods kept on sale. The amount of virtual money given to them will be based on their performance in the previous round. The goods they purchase will have to be used to create an electronic product or model which they have to successfully market and advertise. Bidding will take 30 mins followed by 45 mins for making a model and preparing a presentation. Each team will get 5 mins to present their model and advertisement to the judges\r\n",
